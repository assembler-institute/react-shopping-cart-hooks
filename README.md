# Assembler School: React Shopping Cart React Router

In this project you will learn how to create a React.js and how to apply all the
important concepts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### The repository

First, you will need to `clone` or `fork` the repository into your Github
account:

<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg" alt="Fork on GitHub" width='450'>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/assembler-school/react-shopping-cart-react-router.git
```

## Contents and Branches Naming Strategy

The repository is made up of several branches that include the contents of each
section.

The branches follow a naming strategy like the following:

- `main`: includes the main contents and the instructions
- `assembler-solution`: includes the solution

### Fetching All the Branches

In order to fetch all the remote branches in the repository, you can use the
following command:

```sh
$ git fetch --all
```

### List Both Remote Tracking Branches and Local Branches

```sh
$ git branch --all
```

Then, you can create a local branch based on a remote branch with the following
command:

```sh
$ git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <remote_branch_name>
```

### Installing

First, you will need to install the dependencies with: `npm install`.

Run the following command in your terminal after cloning the main repo:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Running the Tests

The tests that validate your solution can be executed by running the following
command:

```
$ npm run test
```

### Git `precommit` and `prepush` Hooks

In the `assembler-solution` branch you can see an implementation of these tools
if you'd like to use them.

## Deployment

In this pill we won't deploy the app.

## Technologies used

- `React.js`
- `@testing-library/react`
- `eslint`
- `prettier`
- `lint-staged`
- `husky`

## Project requirements

This is an overview of the main requirements of this project. The exact ones are
found in the doc that the academic team will provide you.

- You must follow all the instructions of the project step-by-step
- You should always try to solve them by yourself before asking for help
- You should always help your team members and fellow students of the master so
  that you can all learn together and become better software developers and team
  members
- You must finish all the steps that are marked as `Required`
- You must use semantic HTML5 elements for all the markup of the application
- Once you are done, you can move on to the optional ones that are marked as
  `Extra 💯`

### 1. `/new-product` route

#### File

```sh
/src/App.js
```

1. uncomment all the code
2. add the `Route` component for the path
   1. path: `/new-product`
   2. component: `NewProduct` from the pages folder
   3. follow the code that is used to render the `Home` component route

#### Test suite name

@TODO

### 2. `NewProductForm` component

#### File

```sh
/src/components/NewProductForm/NewProductForm.js
```

1. uncomment all the code
2. finish the `setState` code so that a `setSubmitted()` method can be called
   that sets the `submitted: true` prop after a timeout, like `500ms`.
3. this prop is used to conditionally render the
   `{submitted && <Redirect to="/" />}` code in the same file
4. this will save the new form and once the `submitted` prop is `true`, the form
   will redirect to the home page

#### Test suite name

@TODO
